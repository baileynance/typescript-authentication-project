# Overview

In order to become more efficient with front-end development, specifically in reference to developing JavaScript based programs, TypeScript is a skill that I have wanted to become more accustom to utilizing. TypeScript based programs allow the developer to find type errors and errors in logic early, so that debugging and integration issues will occur less often. This is a vital skill that any front end developer should have, therfore I have created a personal project to allow myself to polish these skills.

The project will be to write a software that authenticates a user when registering, managing, and signing into an account. As every website, with the purpose of bringing the user back, will have a function to create an account and save information, it is important to keep the users information safe and protected. That is why I will be using TypeScript to create a program that does just that.

My purpose for wanting to create this project is to showcase my ability to use TypeScript in real world scenarios. Security is one the biggest concerns in the software development world. Developing this project has allowed me to expand my skillbase and become more value to any company looking for a developer who knows both TypeScript functionality and security development in software.
